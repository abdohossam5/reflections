When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I am sure that I want to make the changes public immediatley.
=================================
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becuase there might be some changes on the remote repo that doesn't affect my work so it won't
be needed for me. I can only pull the changes if i want to review work done by others or if my
work is affected by changes done on the remote.
