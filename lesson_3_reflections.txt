When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I am sure that I want to make the changes public immediatley.
=================================
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becuase there might be some changes on the remote repo that doesn't affect my work so it won't
be needed for me. I can only pull the changes if i want to review work done by others or if my
work is affected by changes done on the remote.
=================================
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: to copy someone else's repo on GitHub. use it if i don't have permission to make edits to a repo
clones: clone a repo remotly or locally. download a repo to local machine.
branches: you create when u want to work on a feature or fix a bug while leaving the master as it is.
=================================
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

You can safely work on it and then use fast forward merge to sync the local version with
the remote one.
=================================
How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

we would do it manually by checking the differences between our codes.
using command on cmd.
make everyone wait for the other one to finish working.
=================================
When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master?
What benefits does each approach have?

When i am testing a new feature or fixinf a bug.
working on the master makes it easier but you might end up missing the whole code.
while working on branches makes it more complicated to merge this branches back to master
but your master version is safe and won't be messed up.
