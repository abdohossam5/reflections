When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

when I am sure that I want to make the changes public immediatley.
=================================
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

becuase there might be some changes on the remote repo that doesn't affect my work so it won't
be needed for me. I can only pull the changes if i want to review work done by others or if my
work is affected by changes done on the remote.
=================================
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks: to copy someone else's repo on GitHub. use it if i don't have permission to make edits to a repo
clones: clone a repo remotly or locally. download a repo to local machine.
branches: you create when u want to work on a feature or fix a bug while leaving the master as it is.
