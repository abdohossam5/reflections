showed the differences between the versions
we did't have to go through the whole file
Saved alot of time
===================
keep trace of why the changes were made
know who made the changes
being able to undo changes if they didn't work out
===================
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually
choosing when to create a commit,
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved,
like Google Docs does?

pros: 
u r in control
each commit represents a logical changes
u can easily understand the history of ur commits
cons:
u may forget to commit
risk of losing work
===================
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git
, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
 like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
 
 because changes in different files may be done to address
 one logical issue. files may be highly related in programming.
 while in WP or GDocs each file or page is a seperate entity.
 ===================
 How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
 history of files?
 
 git log will provide all the branches made
 git diff will allow us to compare differences between branches
 ===================
 How might using version control make you more confident to make
 changes that could break something?
 
 because I know that i can be able to run previous commits at any time
 and be able to spot where exactly did i go wrong by using git diff 
 to compare commits so i can fix any bugs that occured because of 
 my new changes.
 ===================
 what do you want to try using Git for?
